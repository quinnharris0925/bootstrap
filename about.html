        <p id="about">Guidance is an app for students to help manage and maximize their time and goals throughout their college experience. Upon starting college courses the user will put in their major, class schedule, work schedule and any upcoming assignments they have so they can plan their time accordingly. As time goes on and the student checks off more classes they will begin to be paired with internships and jobs that apply to what the student has been studying. Upon graduation our app would focus predominantly on the user being placed in a career/entry level job.
